          <p>of</p>

<p>Travis CI GmbH, Rigaer Straße 8, 10247 Berlin, registered with the commercial register of the local court in Charlottenburg (Berlin) under HRB 140133 B (hereinafter “Travis CI”),</p>

<p>regarding the software Travis CI (hereinafter “Travis CI Software”)</p>

<p>as of 05/2018</p>

<h3 id="subject-matter">Subject matter <a href="#subject-matter" class="toc-anchor">#</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>The subject matter of these terms and conditions (hereinafter <strong>“Terms and Conditions”</strong>) is the use of Travis CI Software. The Terms and Conditions regulate all relations between Travis CI and Travis CI’s customer (hereinafter <strong>“Customer”</strong>) regarding the use of Travis CI Software and are part of the Agreement as defined below. Standard business conditions and/or general terms and conditions of the Customer do not apply, regardless of whether or not Travis CI has expressly objected to them in a particular case.</li>
  <li>Travis CI communicates with the GitHub hosting service (hereinafter <strong>“GitHub”</strong>), which is offered by GitHub Inc. on the Customer’s behalf. Condition to the proper use of Travis CI Software is a valid contract with GitHub Inc. on the use of GitHub, which may lead to costs on the Customer’s sole responsibility. The Customer will provide Travis CI with his GitHub account information (hereinafter <strong>“GitHub Sign-In”</strong>) when signing in through GitHub via travis CI-ci.com (hereinafter the <strong>“Website”</strong>) automatically. He allows Travis CI to access the Customer’s GitHub account. Travis CI will directly communicate in the name of the Customer with GitHub and the Customer authorizes Travis CI to act on his behalf towards GitHub Inc. The Customer is solely liable for any costs or damages that GitHub Inc. associates with the GitHub Sign-In.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="scope-of-services">Scope of services <a href="#scope-of-services" class="toc-anchor">#</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Travis CI provides Travis CI Software as a service. This means, that Travis CI Software may be used via the internet only.</li>
  <li>The Travis CI Software is a hosted continuous integration service that provides the infrastructure for testing software projects subject to downtime and service suspensions as described below. The functional range of the service is dependent on the package the Customer chooses and will be displayed on the Website.</li>
  <li>Travis CI offers its services for (i) closed software projects, where the projects cannot be viewed publicly and (ii) open software projects, where the projects including their source codes can be viewed publicly.</li>
  <li>The Travis CI Software is integrated with GitHub and offers support for several programming languages. The entire list of supported programming languages is available at about.travis CI-ci.org.</li>
  <li>No consultancy, training, trouble shooting or support is within the scope of the services offered by Travis CI under this Agreement if and to the extent they are not part of the agreed warranty as set out in section 9 hereunder.</li>
  <li>Travis CI offers unpaid and paid services. If a service by Travis CI is offered free of charge, section 8 shall apply.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="concluding-of-the-agreement">Concluding of the Agreement <a href="#concluding-of-the-agreement" class="toc-anchor">#</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Using the Travis CI Software requires the opening of an account via the Website by using the Customer’s GitHub Sign-In (hereinafter the <strong>“Account”</strong>). Travis CI offers the use of the Travis CI Software only to entrepreneurs within the meaning of section 14 (1) of the German Civil Code.</li>
  <li>The opening of an Account by the Customer is deemed an offer to conclude an agreement under these Terms and Conditions with Travis CI (hereinafter the <strong>“Agreement”</strong>). Travis CI may at its own discretion accept this offer by explicitly accepting it or rendering services under this Agreement.</li>
  <li>An Account may only be used by one single person. The Customer is entitled to create separate Accounts for his employees.</li>
  <li>The person opening the Account represents that he/she has the legal authority to bind the legal entity he/she acts for to this Agreement and may in knowledge of this Agreement provide the GitHub Sign-Ins to Travis CI.</li>
  <li>In connection with the registration the customer is obliged to
    <ul>
      <li>make precise and correct allegations and to correct the data if changes accrue;</li>
      <li>keep Account data confidential at all times and to do everything to avoid any third party getting hold of the data. In this respect ‘third party’ also includes all employees of the Customer that are not designated to use the Travis CI Software;</li>
      <li>immediately inform Travis CI in case of loss, theft or other disclosure of the Account data to a third party or in a suspicion of misuse of the Account data and to immediately change the password;</li>
      <li>allow the use of the Account data only designated administrators to be specified in the registration procedure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="obligations-of-the-customer">Obligations of the customer <a href="#obligations-of-the-customer" class="toc-anchor">#</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Customer is obliged to make agreed payments in due time.</li>
  <li>The Customer must not interfere or intent to interfere in any manner with the functionality or proper working of the Travis CI Software.</li>
  <li>The Customer must take care for regular backups of his software. When delivering its services Travis CI assumes that the software builds of the Customer tested are copies only and will not be used in real environments.</li>
  <li>The Customer is obliged to use the Travis CI Software and services in an appropriate way. In particular, any use and/or actions considered ‘Bitcoin-Mining’ is not accepted by Travis CI.</li>
  <li>When using testing data the Customer will make sure that these data do not contain unanonymized personal data of real people.</li>
  <li>The Customer will indemnify and hold harmless Travis CI, its officers and directors, employees and agents from any and all third party claims, damages, costs and (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of the Customer’s use of the Travis CI Software in a manner not authorized by this Agreement, and/or applicable law, or the Customer’s or it’s employees’ or personnel’s negligence or willful misconduct.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="downtime-and-services-suspensions">Downtime and services suspensions <a href="#downtime-and-services-suspensions" class="toc-anchor">#</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Adjustments, changes and updates of the Travis CI Software that help to avoid or maintain dysfunctions of the Travis CI Software may lead to temporary service suspensions. Travis CI will try to limit downtime of the service or restrictions of accessibility to 10 hours a month. Travis CI will try to do regular maintenance works during the weekend or at times between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. (CET). Outside of the said hours, Travis CI will inform the Customer about upcoming maintenance works.</li>
  <li>The Customer is aware that the service relies on a working internet infrastructure. Additional downtime of the service can occur if the website is not available and at any other time with restrictive access to the internet of the Customer.</li>
  <li>The Customer is aware that the Travis CI Software does not work if GitHub is not properly available (be it to Travis CI or the Customer).</li>
  <li>For the avoidance of doubt, in case of dysfunctions of the Travis CI Software caused by Travis CI through willful intent or gross negligence, Travis CI’s liability for such dysfunctions is not excluded by this section 5</li>
