    <p><strong>Visiting the Website</strong></p>

    <p>We (or the webspace provider) collect data about each visit of the Website (so-called server logfiles) (“Access Data”). Access Data includes the following:</p>

    <p>Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, User’s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider</p>

These data are then stored because this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our Website and Travis CI Software and, if necessary, allow us to investigate any crimes committed. The storage of these data is necessary in order to protect us as the person responsible for processing the data. As a matter of principle, these data will not be passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to pass it on or the transfer of data serves criminal prosecution purposes.</p>

These data are processed on servers in the USA. MailChimp is certified according to “Privacy Shield”. The “Privacy Shield” is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the USA to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in the USA.</p>

    <p>Mailchimp is a service with which the dispatch of newsletters can be organized and analyzed. With the help of Mailchimp we can analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an e-mail sent with Mailchimp, a file contained in the e-mail (so-called web beacon) connects to the Mailchimp servers in the USA. This allows you to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of registration, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. They are used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.</p>

    <p>If you do not want Mailchimp to analyze your data, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a respective link in every newsletter.</p>

    <p>Details on Mailchimp and its privacy policy can be found here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</p>

    <p>The data are stored for the purpose of newsletter subscription will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of MailChimp after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email address for the use of the Travis CI Software) remain unaffected.</p>

    <p>Each User can withdraw their consent to the storage of data, the email address and their respective use for sending the newsletter at any time. This can be done free of charge (except for the transmission costs) and via a link in the newsletter itself or notification to us or, if applicable, to Mailchimp.</p>
